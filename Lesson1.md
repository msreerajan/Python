# Introduction to Python
## Basic commands 

### version check 
> to check the version of your python install execute this code in the shell window 

```
python --version

```

### a python program 
python program is written in a file with extension **Filename.py**

### executing a python program 
there are two ways to execute a python program. 
> you use a command line/terminal(mac) to execute a **python file** - the command would be 

```
python3 main.py

```

The above command will execute a file named "main.py" 

> let us try the execution 

note the number after the command "python" denotes the version number

or you can open a python command/terminal/shell 


> let us try 

on the right side tab, select the "**Shell**" tab 

you will see a prompt "~/Python-Workshop$"

> type in the command

```
 python3 
```
you will see the python prompt "**>>>**", this is where you could execute any python command and you will see the result immediately. 

> let us try - to print anything on the screen. 
use the following command

```
print("Hello World!!!")

```

you see that it will print the text in the double quotes. 

## Difference between Shell and Console
- Shell is a command interface where you will be able to execute one command at a time to which you will immediately see the output following the command 
- Console is a output screen. It provides a way to show the out put on a command or a group of commands in a file


# Session work 

> ##  Predict 
what would be the output of the commmands below

```
Print("This is a test")

```

```
print("PRINT WORKS GREAT!")

```

```
print(1,2,3)
```
```
print('one','two','three')
```

> ##  Investigate/Challenge
Find the reason of the error in the command below

```
print(can you figure out what just happened)

```

Observe what is printed on this command 
```
print('hello', 'world', '!!!')
```
Now try this and note what differnce does it made 
```
print('hello', 'world', '!!!', sep='')
```
Now try this and note the diffence in the output
```
print('hello', 'world', '!!!', sep='\n')
```
> ## Develop 
print a pyramid like this 

```
   *
  * *
 * * *

 ```

When you are done. Validate your output by testing the code. 

> ## How to validate your output
In Repl the toolbar on the left side has a check mark at the bottom. 
- Click on that check mark. 
- Click on "Run Tests"
