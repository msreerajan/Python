# Data Types, Conditional execution

## Data Types

### the type function
> The type function could be used to detect the type of the value passed in. Consider the code below

```
i = 10
print(type(i))
```
Following table provides a list of all data types in Python

|Data type |Description  | Example|
---------|---------|--------
|str| string | name = "hello"|
|int| integer/whole number/+ or -ve | i = 10|
|float| decimal | j = 3.14|
|complex| complex(imaginary) | k=1j|
|list| collection(list of values) | fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]|
|tuple| collection | vegs = ("pepper","onions")|
|range| string | seq = range(6)|
|dict| dictionary | person={"name" : "Pratyusha", "age" : "14"}|
|set| collection | names ={"Ron","Smyan","Dia"}|
|bool| true/false | sign = True|


> while you python implicitly identifies the data type based on the value, you could explicitly set the data type as below 

```
number = int(10)
#or
pi = float(3.14)

print(type(number))
print(type(pi))

```

### the random number function 
Programming languages consist of a function which can generate a random number. It is mostly used ot bring a variance automatically generated by the computer. 

> Python does not include a random() function but it has a in-built module that serves the same purpose. Inorder to use it, we will have to first use an import statement 

```
import random
print(random.randrange(2,6))

```

## If condition

It is imperative to execute conditional statements in programming, simple because all forms of output depends on certain condition. And thus all programming languages include a condition statement

> in its simples form it looks like this 

>> if this condition is met  
    >>> do this 

> let us try one such example 

```
i = 2

if i > 0:
  print("i is a positive number")

```

> can you think of way to improvise this, so we could also code when the condition is not met?

it should look something like this 

> if this condition is met  

>> do this  

>or else  

>>    do that 

```
i = 2

if i > 0:
  print("i is a positive number")
else:
  print("is is a negative number")

```

- did you figure out a problem with the above code??? 
- what is you enter the value of i to 0?

obviously it is not true, since 0 is neither positive or negative. How can we solve this???

### the Elif condition 
 in its simplicity, it is as below 

> if this condition is met  

>> do this  

>or else if this condition is met

>>    do this 

>or else  

>>    do that 


> let us try this 


```
i = 2

if i > 0:
  print("i is a positive number")  
elif i < 0:
  print("i is a negative number")
else:  
  print("i is zero")

```

# Session work 

> ##  Predict 
what would be the output of the commmands below

```
i = 10
i = i - 4.5

print(type(i))

```

```
i = "10"

print(type(i))

```

```
fruits = ["apple","orange","banana"]
print(fruits)

```


> ##  Investigate/Challenge
Find the reason of the error in the command below

```
i ='1'

i = i + 1

print(type(i))

```

Fix the error and observe the output of this code below. Can you figure out the reasoning behind the output
```
number = int(input("enter a even number"))

if number >0:
  print("number is a positive number")
else 
  print("number is a negative number or zero")

```


Fix the code below to run
```
name = "Neal"

if name == "neal":
print("Hi Neal")
else:
  print("Hi friend")
```
